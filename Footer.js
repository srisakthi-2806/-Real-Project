<p>A qualified maintainer inspects the vehicle during the periodic servicing and undertakes necessary repair or replacement. Failing which, it may lead to cascading effect and turn the associated components defective. Consequently, the overall health of the vehicle increases considerably.Properly maintained engines can often get 200,000 or more miles on them during their lifetime. This is a lot of value for your car. However, failing to take care of your engine can cause it to fail much earlier in its lifetime.
Running repairs are the services required in the car, when a part is not working in right condition or may have worn out to the point that replacement or repairs are required to maintain the performance of your car.
In a regular car service, its oil, coolants, fluids, etc are checked. They are changed if required. Well-oiled car components undergo less friction while running, thus leading to vastly reduced wear and tear.

Regular maintenance improves safety
Faulty headlights, under-inflated tyres, and leaky brake fluid tank; these minor problems can cause serious accidents when left unchecked. Even an uncharged battery can result in engine break down while you’re travelling. Imagine being stuck on a desolate road where anything can happen.

The good thing is you can prevent these accidents and breakdowns with regular vehicle maintenance. A well-maintained car is a safe car that you can drive with peace of mind, whether you are off for a long trip or just travelling a short distance.</p>
